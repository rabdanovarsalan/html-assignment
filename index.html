        <p>Hi, this is Arsalan Rabdanov, an international student. 
            I am from <em>Buryatia</em>, one of the republics within <em>Russia</em>.
            I was born at August 29<sup>th</sup>, year 2000 Ulan-Ude, Buryatia's capital that is home for 400 thousand people.
            The city is known for a monument of Lenin's head that is the largest one in the world. A constant reminder of Russia's bolshevist era.
            I came to Canada to pursue my goals of getting education and becoming a quality specialist.</p>

        During my free time, I enjoy:
        <ul>
            <li>Playing games on my computer. Currently I am hooked on Darkest Dungeon 2 and Rebel Inc.</li>
            <li>Walking when its cool outside.</li>
            <li>Listenint to music. Lately I'm into rock.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I must admit that I am prone to procrastination and overconfidence.
            They are the reason I have to completely retake Interactive Media Design first term.
            I really <strong>do</strong> find this program very interesting and enjoyable,
            and the prospects of becoming a Web Developer attracting and exciting.
            There are just some problems with me that I am keeping working on.
            I <strong>do care</strong> about being a functioning member of society, and I am determined to 
            use my opportunity.
        </p>
